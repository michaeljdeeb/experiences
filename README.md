experiences
===========

A visual theme for Jekyll, meant to be used as a photo gallery. You can see a demo of it [here](http://michaeljdeeb.com/experiences/)

### Photo Grouping Classes
`side-by-side-same-aspect` - Two images contained by a parent element with this class will be displayed next to each other in a post. Use this class if they are the same orientation. These images will overflow the text margins on mobile.

`side-by-side-mixed-aspect` - Two images contained by a parent element with this class will be displayed next to each other in a post. Use this class if they are the different orientation. These images will overflow the text margins on mobile.

NOTE: This class only works with 4:3 images.

`overflow` - Photos with this class will overflow the text margins on mobile.

`single-centered` - Photos with this class will be centered horizontally. Photos with this class will also never be larger than 100vh minus the height of the navigation bar.
